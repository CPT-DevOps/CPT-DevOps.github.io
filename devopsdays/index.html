  <h1>Event</h1>
  <p>DevOpsDays, the international conference for all DevOps enthusiasts, is finally in Africa! DevOpsDays
  Cape Town, South Africa will be hosting its very first conference on 7 and 8 November 2016 at the
  DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Woodstock.</p>

  <p>DevOpsDays is a technical conference, aimed at developers, sysadmins, engineers and anyone else
  involved in technology, whether expert or beginner.</p>

  <p>DevOps is all about bridging the gap between Development and Operations. Agile techniques used in
  development have a significant impact on the way Operations organises its work. Likewise, Operations
  and Sysadmins are becoming Programmers as a result of trends in virtualisation and automation where
  everything is managed through an API.</p>

  <p>Special accommodation rates are available at DoubleTree for the duration of the conference. Please
  contact <a href="mailto:organisers@devops.capetown">organisers@devops.capetown</a> for more info.</p>

  <h1>Conduct</h1>

  <h2>ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY</h2>
  <p>DevOpsDays is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, 
  regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. 
  We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery 
  is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these 
  rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the 
  conference organisers.</p>

  <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, 
  physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, 
  stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, 
  inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any 
  harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

  <p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the 
  anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other 
  material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, 
  or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

  <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they 
  deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

  <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, 
  please contact a member of conference staff immediately.</p>

  <p>Conference staff can be identified by distinct staff badges. Conference staff will be happy to help 
  participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise 
  assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your 
  attendance.</p>

  <p>We expect participants to adhere to the code of conduct at all conference venues and 
  conference-related social events.</p>

  <h2>CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>

  <p>I. I am an attendee at DevOpsDays, learning from and sharing with other DevOpsDays attendees in 
  an effort to better myself and my industry. I co-create the experience with fellow attendees. I am 
  prepared to give my energy, presence and sensitivity to creating the best possible experience for 
  myself and others.</p>

  <p>II. I am coming to DevOpsDays to interact with people. I understand that imagery and language which 
  is suggestive or derogatory will offend and make people uncomfortable. I also understand that people 
  may have boundaries and sensibilities different from my own. I will accept without question when 
  informed that something is offensive or unacceptable in the context of the DevOpsDays event.</p>

  <p>III. I will never intentionally harass or offend another attendee regardless of gender, sexual orientation, 
  disability, appearance, size, race or religion and will not abide another attendee being harassed or 
  offended. If I am aware that anyone is uncomfortable or unsafe, I will notify those giving offense and 
  the DevOpsDays event organisers.</p>

  <p>IV. If I am offended or harassed, I will inform people around me who make me feel safe and the event 
  organisers. If I feel safe, at my discretion, I will inform those giving offense of the specific actions with 
  the hope that the other party is well-intentioned and ignorant, but I am under no obligation to do so.</p>

  <p>V. I understand that people are different and I attempt to be forgiving of others actions at the level of 
  their sincere intent, but my priority is protecting my safety and the safety of others. I will act without 
  hesitation or reservation until there are no question of the safety of all parties.</p>

  <p>VI. I trust the DevOpsDays organisers and attendees will co-create the best possible experience for 
  everyone involved, as I will. I believe DevOpsDays is about empowering people and I will not forget I 
  am empowered to create a safe and nurturing environment. If I or any other attendee violates this 
  aspect of the event, I expect the conference organisers to protect the attendees by direct action, 
  including expelling those in violation and contacting the proper authorities.</p>
