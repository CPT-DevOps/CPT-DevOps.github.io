Join us on Thursday 27 October for a talk about Robert's experiece with Terraform and Ansible.

**Robert Stuttaford**: Terraform + Ansible experience report

A review of how I went about reproducing a production environment (built with CloudFormation) from first principles with Terraform and Ansible.

http://github.com/robert-stuttaford/terraform-example

- Multiple environments.
- Centralised control variables.
- Ansible via SSH and via auto-scaling.

If I convince you to try it out for your systems, I've won; but actually, I'm hoping to be made aware of mistakes that I have made. I'm hoping that I can learn from you :-)

## Parking

There is parking available across from 22seven's door (on the lefthand side in Hout street, between Loop and Long), they are scattered from the 2nd floor up and clearly marked. Just indicate to the guard at the entrance that you are going to 22seven.

## RSVP

If you plan on attending, we kindly ask that you RSVP on Meetup to give us an idea of attendee numbers.
