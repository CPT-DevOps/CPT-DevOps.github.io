Join us on Tuesday 17 May for a talk about Rancher, an open-source platform for Docker orchestration. 

**Marcin Jekot**: How is Rancher workin' out for ya?

Rancher has got quite a pitch and promises a lot. But how does it fare in real life? I would like to share with you why it looked like a good fit for us (hint hint, no vendor lock-ins to AWS or Heroku. Linux as a work horse FTW, and many more). Next, to share some of the experiences of using it in real life. And finally a live demo... bring a laptop and let's hit this thing while we re-deploy a service.

## Parking

There is parking available across from 22seven's door (on the lefthand side in Hout street, between Loop and Long), they are scattered from the 2nd floor up and clearly marked. Just indicate to the guard at the entrance that you are going to 22seven.

## RSVP

If you plan on attending, we kindly ask that you RSVP on Meetup to give us an idea of attendee numbers.
