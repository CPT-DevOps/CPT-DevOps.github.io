# Code of Conduct

The Cape Town DevOps community group is intended to be an inclusive and diverse forum for fostering collaboration and sharing of knowledge and experiences. Community members can expect a fun and welcoming environment where varied viewpoints are encouraged.

DevOps Cape Town is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from an event or communication forum at the discretion of the organising committee.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community event or communication channel. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.

We expect participants to adhere to the code of conduct at all community events, community-related social events and community communication channels.

If you are being harassed, you notice that someone else is being harassed, or you have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organising team immediately. You may also send a message to the organising team (anonymously or otherwise) by emailing [organisers@devops.capetown](mailto:organisers@devops.capetown).
