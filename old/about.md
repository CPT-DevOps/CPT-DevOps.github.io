Cape Town DevOps is a community group in [Cape Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town), [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa). We are committed to furthering the adoption of DevOps practises in our home city and we seek to encourage sharing of knowledge and experiences through our [regular meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-DevOps/).

We hang out online in the [#devops](https://zatech.slack.com/messages/devops) channel of the ZA Tech Slack group, an active and diverse community which is free and open for anyone to join. Visit [zatech.co.za](http://zatech.co.za) to receive an invitation email and kindly review the [code of conduct](https://github.com/zatech/code-of-conduct).

Our community is run by volunteers in their free time and we welcome any and all participation. DevOps Cape Town Pty Ltd is the entity through which we administer our events.

If you want to get involved, we encourage you to attend one of our regular meetups. The format of our events typically involves a talk or presentation by a community member, followed by open discussion, often with food and drink provided by community members and sponsors. Joining our [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-DevOps/) will sign you up to our mailing list and you'll receive announcements of upcoming events.
